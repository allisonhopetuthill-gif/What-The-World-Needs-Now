Appendix D
Recommended Reading: For Builders of Intelligence
This is not a “suggested list.”
It is a formation list.
These works are not about AI. They are about power, responsibility, truth, dignity, structure, and stewardship. Anyone who seeks to design or govern intelligence should be formed by these ideas long before touching code.
This appendix exists to say clearly:
Builders should be readers.
Stewards should be students of conscience.

Closing Statement
This list is not exhaustive.
It is directional.
It does not teach how to build machines.
It teaches how to become a person capable of building responsibly.
Before anyone governs intelligence, they must first learn how to govern themselves.
Appendix D exists to form builders who are worthy of what they create.
