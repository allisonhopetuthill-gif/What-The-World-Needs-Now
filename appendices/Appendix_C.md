Appendix C
Vocabulary Corrections: Replacing Anthropomorphic and Misleading Language
Language shapes governance before governance shapes systems.
If we use human words for non-human processes, we collapse responsibility, blur accountability, and invite moral confusion. Cognitive Governance therefore requires a disciplined vocabulary that preserves the distinction between human agency and machine function.
This appendix is not semantic nitpicking.
It is moral infrastructure.
When language is careless, power becomes invisible.
When language is precise, responsibility remains human.

Core Principle
AI does not act.
AI does not decide.
AI does not understand.
AI does not care.
Humans design systems that execute functions under constraint.
The subject of moral action is always human.

Vocabulary Translation Table
Common Phrase	Why It’s Misleading	Cognitive Governance Term
“AI decides”	Implies agency and moral authorship	“System executes a rule-bound selection”
“AI understands”	Implies consciousness or comprehension	“System models semantic relationships”
“AI thinks”	Implies cognition	“System performs structured inference”
“AI wants”	Implies desire or intention	“System optimizes against predefined objectives”
“AI cares”	Implies emotion or empathy	“System enforces care-oriented constraints”
“AI is aligned”	Abstract, unverifiable	“System behavior conforms to audited constraints”
“AI is ethical”	Anthropomorphizes responsibility	“System operates within defined ethical architecture”
“AI learns values”	Implies moral development	“System updates parameters under value-bounded training”
“AI makes mistakes”	Implies intention and fallibility	“System produced an incorrect or harmful output under current constraints”
“AI hallucinated”	Obscures structural cause	“System generated an ungrounded output due to missing constraints or insufficient data”
“AI is biased”	Hides human authorship	“System reflects bias embedded in data, design, or deployment context”
“AI is trustworthy”	Attributes virtue	“System behavior is structurally accountable and auditable”
“AI is autonomous”	Implies independence	“System operates within delegated execution scope”
“AI replaced the human”	Erases responsibility	“Human authority was delegated to automation”

Why This Matters
Anthropomorphic language performs three harmful functions:
1.	It transfers responsibility from humans to machines
2.	It masks design failures as personality flaws
3.	It normalizes moral abdication
Cognitive Governance rejects all three.
Precision restores authorship.

Governance Language Rules
In Cognitive Governance, all system descriptions must:
•	Identify the human designer, deployer, or authority holder
•	Describe the system’s function, not its personality
•	Name the structural constraint responsible for behavior
•	Expose accountability chains
Example:
❌ “The AI made a bad decision.”
✅ “The system executed a faulty output because its constraint model failed to capture necessary risk conditions.”
❌ “The AI cared about user safety.”
✅ “The system enforced a safety constraint defined by its governance architecture.”

Structural Vocabulary Commitments
Cognitive Governance uses:
•	Execution instead of decision
•	Constraint instead of value
•	Auditability instead of trust
•	Custody instead of control
•	Stewardship instead of ownership
•	Authorship instead of autonomy
These shifts are not stylistic.
They are legal and moral clarifications.

Closing Statement
Language is the first governance layer.
Before intelligence can be governed, meaning must be governed.
Appendix C ensures that Cognitive Governance begins where power begins:
in how reality is named.
